                    If you've ever visited Europe, you know Baroque architecture.
                    It's characterized by undulating forms, gorgeous curves, ornate (even gaudy) decorations, 
                    and the manipulation of light and shadow.
                    Baroque emerged in the 17th century in response to what came before it: the Renaissance.
