    <h2> Renaissance Masterpieces</h2>
    <h3> Contemporary Influences</h3>
    <p>
        Renaissance Architecture originated in Italy
        and superseded the Gothic style over a period
     generally defined as 1400 to 1600. Features of Renaissance 
     buildings include the use of the classical orders and mathematically
      precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for
       symmetry, proportion, and harmony. Columns, pediments, arches and 
       domes are imaginatively used in buildings of all types.

                    If you've ever visited Europe, you know Baroque architecture.
                    It's characterized by undulating forms, gorgeous curves, ornate (even gaudy) decorations, 
                    and the manipulation of light and shadow.
                    Baroque emerged in the 17th century in response to what came before it: the Renaissance.
