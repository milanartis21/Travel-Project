    <h3> Contemporary Influences</h3>
    <p>
        Renaissance Architecture originated in Italy
        and superseded the Gothic style over a period
     generally defined as 1400 to 1600. Features of Renaissance 
     buildings include the use of the classical orders and mathematically
      precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for
       symmetry, proportion, and harmony. Columns, pediments, arches and 
       domes are imaginatively used in buildings of all types.

            <h4> Baroque</h4>
            <p>
                During the Baroque period (c. 1600â€“1750), architecture, painting, and sculpture were integrated into decorative ensembles. Architecture and sculpture became pictorial, and painting became illusionistic.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5> Architecture Style </h5>
            <p>Baroque art was essentially concerned with the dramatic and the illusory, with vivid colours, hidden light sources, luxurious materials, and elaborate, contrasting surface textures, used to heighten immediacy and sensual delight. Ceilings of Baroque churches, dissolved in painted scenes, presented vivid views of the infinite to the worshiper and directed him through his senses toward heavenly concerns. </p>

            <h4> Rococo</h4>
            <p>
                In Rococo architecture, decorative sculpture and painting are inseparable from the structure. Simple dramatic spatial sequences or the complex interweaving of spaces of 17th-century churches gave way to a new spatial concept.
            </p>
            <h5> Architecture Style </h5>
            <p> Rococo architects obtained unified spaces, emphasized structural elements, created continuous decorative schemes, and reduced column sizes to a minimum. In churches, the ceilings of side aisles were raised to the height of the nave ceiling to unify the space from wall to wall</p>

            <h4>Gothic Revival </h4>
            <p>
                The architectural movement most commonly associated with Romanticism is the Gothic Revival, a term first used in England in the mid-19th century to describe buildings being erected in the style of the Middle Ages and later expanded to embrace the entire Neo-Gothic movement. 
            </p>
            <h5> Architecture Style </h5>
            <p> by the beginning of the 19th century, picturesque planning and grouping provided the basis for experimentation in architecture. Gothic was especially suited to this aim. </p>

                    If you've ever visited Europe, you know Baroque architecture.
                    It's characterized by undulating forms, gorgeous curves, ornate (even gaudy) decorations, 
                    and the manipulation of light and shadow.
                    Baroque emerged in the 17th century in response to what came before it: the Renaissance.
